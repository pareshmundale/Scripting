# Scripting
This is the repository for automating the simple but time comsuming tasks.

I will update the repository as I proceed with the new development.

Json to CSV script is simple script to extract  particular element from the json file and store it in the CSV format.
Why CSV format is chosen?
in one of my postman script I needed a CSV file to automate the collection run.
Note - it supports multiple other file formats as well.
